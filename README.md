# Statistical-learning
The statistical learning project aims to apply all the approaches seen in class to a chosen dataset and select the best model which can explain better our response variable y.
In order to evaluate the performance of each statistical learning method implemented we use the mean squared error also called MSE, but this is not the only parameter used to evaluate a model, we are also considering the complexity of a model.

So the main goal is to find a model which can be accurate (which includes best MSE statistic and residual analysis) and on the same time interpretable, that means the complexity will be reduced in order to provide an understandable solution for the case study.
